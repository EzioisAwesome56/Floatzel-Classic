# Floatzel Classic
Floatzel classic is the old version of my discord bot, before i rewrote it in jda  with the help of godson777. It is written in python 3.5 but will also work on python 3.6. This has the voice support removed unlike some of the eariler versions of the bot.

# Pre-Installation
You need to install atleast python 3.5, though 3.6 will probably work just fine. Then use pip to install discord.py. If you don't use the twitter-less branch, you must also install the python twitter api

# Installation
Installing the bot is simple enough. Just clone the repo, edit config.py and run bot.py. easy enough
