# Floatzel Classic
Floatzel classic is the old version of my discord bot, before i rewrote it in jda  with the help of godson777. It is written in python 3.5 but will also work on python 3.6. This has the voice support removed unlike some of the eariler versions of the bot.

# Installation
Installing the bot is simple enough. Just clone the repo, edit config.py and run bot.py. easy enough
